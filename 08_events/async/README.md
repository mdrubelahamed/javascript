### Two type of code  
1. Blocking Code
2. Non Blocking Code


Js engine, web api, task queue

### how js file works
1. Global Execution
2. Memory creation phase(MCP/CP)
3. Execution phsase(EP)

for every function the 2. and 3. poing will happen for them mean  
for the particular function the CP & EP will happen again and the at the end garbage collection happen mean the function will delete this particular cp & cp memory allocation

for this cp & ep process **_new variable environment_** and **_execution thread_** will get created
